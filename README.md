# Learning Webpage: Linear Search vs Binary Search

## Overview
This project is an **interactive learning webpage** designed to teach and visualize two fundamental computer science concepts: **Linear Search** and **Binary Search**.  

The webpage provides a clear understanding of how each algorithm works, their differences, and real-world examples. It is a helpful resource for students, beginners, and anyone looking to strengthen their understanding of search algorithms.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Step-by-step demonstrations of both Linear and Binary search processes.
- **Concept Explanations**: Detailed descriptions of the algorithms and their working principles.
- **Examples**: Sample arrays and target values to illustrate how each algorithm performs.
- **Comparison**: Key differences between Linear Search and Binary Search.
- **Educational Focus**: Designed to simplify learning with clear visual aids and explanations.

---

## Learning Goals
- Understand the basic logic of **Linear Search** (sequential search).
- Explore the efficiency and limitations of **Binary Search** (requires sorted arrays).
- Compare both algorithms in terms of **time complexity** and **real-world applications**.

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript** for webpage design and interactivity.
- **Visual animations** for step-by-step algorithm execution.

---

## How to Use
1. Open the webpage in any modern web browser.
2. Select which algorithm (Linear or Binary Search) to learn about.
3. Use the interactive demo to visualize how the search progresses through the dataset.
4. Compare their performance with different input sizes.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add custom user input for arrays and target values.
- Include algorithm efficiency analysis (step counter, time complexity graphs).
- Mobile-friendly design enhancements.
